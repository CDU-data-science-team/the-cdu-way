We sit inside a larger team (CDU) which has interests in public health, epidemiology, and advanced analytics (which is where we come in üòÑ).\nWe are a small team, but we have a large diversity in life circumstances. So, we all make work work for our lifestyles. We have a range of skills and areas of expertise and thus working collaboratively to achieve end goals is always recommended.\nWorking Times #  Core hours vary considerably between team members, and there is a lot of flexibility with core hours with prior agreement with the line manager. Flexibility is not only allowed but recommended if it benefits you. Some team members vary their number of hours week to week, working longer some weeks and taking those hours back in subsequent weeks. Team members may send messages out of hours, but that is purely because it works for them, and will not expect anything immediate in response.\nWorking Location #  The team is primarily virtual. If desired there is space in Nottingham (Duncan Macmillan House - Mapperley) that can be utilised, and some people do hybrid working. The wider CDU (outside of the data science team) are considering some in person social events but there is no pressure for attendance and nothing critical happens.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/the-cdu-way/docs/r_development/","title":"R development","section":"Docs","content":"Chapter 1 #  This is the page that your reader will see when they click this chapter.\nYou can add sections nested inside this chapter by adding .md files to this folder\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/the-cdu-way/docs/introduction/communication/","title":"Communication","section":"Introduction","content":"Alongside the trust tools such as email and MS Teams the team uses the NHS-R slack for communication thing. We have our own channel (private). This can be used for general work enquires but is also used much more casually. It is an acceptable way to communicate things like sickness of last-minute absence. We do have a team email which we have for things like arranging UYD meetings.\nData Science Trophy #  One of the ways we celebrate each other and the successes we have is by presenting each other with a ‚Äútrophy‚Äù in the slack channel. This is for good code, problem solving, anything that deserves a special mention.\nBirthdays #  We don‚Äôt buy gifts for each other within the team, but we do like a good excuse for a celebration and a get together. Which brought in a tradition referred to as the ‚Äúbirthday challenge‚Äù. This is where the team presents you with a task. This task does commonly revolve around an area which you may need to practise and develop skills in. Although may be done in such a way to cause minor irritation. However, it all ends with an e-card, a personalized slack emoji, and a lot of cheers.\nChristmas #  For Christmas we do like to have a get together virtually, traditionallcd //y will involve some kind of silly dress code and be a time to get together. There will often be a quiz or other type of game.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/the-cdu-way/docs/meetings_appraisals/etiquette/","title":"Etiquette","section":"Meetings and appraisals","content":"Diary management #   Put meetings in your diary, including personal things that happen during daytime (you can use personal) It should always be as up to date as possible but at least make sure when the week starts before our team meeting it is accurate as can be Everyone in the team should be able to view everyone else\u0026rsquo;s diary Accept or decline meetings.

Very informal Code Review: Fortnightly Friday 1100-1200 there is a meeting called Code Review but is very loosely a code review as sometimes we have general discussions around approaching a problem, may be a problem with code you want support with, could be showing off some snazzy code or anything that getting a quorum on is beneficial. There are a few other analytically minded people who are invited outside our team Catch Up: Fortnightly people have an official catch up with line manager. Random chats between are encouraged Understanding Your Data (UYD): This is a meeting we set up to try and engage with the wider trust and ICS. We discuss a variety of topics, and it is a good way to sometimes showcase our work, to have a general discussion or to get feedback on a certain spec such as team organisations CDU Business Meeting: A monthly meeting with wider CDU.
