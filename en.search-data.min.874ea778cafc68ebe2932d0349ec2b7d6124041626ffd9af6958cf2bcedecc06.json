Reach out to PAs is appropriate or offer a few options Name them something that makes sense when read in anyone’s diary (catch up with me and you, not just catch up with you) If booking a meeting with the team, especially if recurring, it should be done from team email address so anyone can alter it later  Cancelling/rearranging meetings #   Always give as much notice as possible, changing meetings on the day they are due to occur should only happen in emergencies Always be honest with why it is changing Sometimes meetings change and it is unavoidable, be clear as to why, is the plan to reschedule or to cancel.
