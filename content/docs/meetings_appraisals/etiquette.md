## Diary management

* Put meetings in your diary, including personal things that happen during daytime (you can use personal)
* It should always be as up to date as possible but at least make sure when the week starts before our team meeting it is accurate as can be
* Everyone in the team should be able to view everyone else's diary
* Accept or decline meetings. Use **Tentative** sparingly- seeing tentative across the diary all the time is confusing
* Select the appropriate busy/free status with the consideration how it impacts teams (out of office is good for showing away from computer for example for personal calls etc)

## Booking meetings

* Where known consider people’s working patterns
* Check diaries, most people you can see some free/busy options
* Some people’s diaries are particularly chaotic. Reach out to PAs is appropriate or offer a few options
* Name them something that makes sense when read in anyone’s diary (catch up with me and you, not just catch up with you)
* If booking a meeting with the team, especially if recurring, it should be done from team email address so anyone can alter it later

## Cancelling/rearranging meetings

* Always give as much notice as possible, changing meetings on the day they are due to occur should only happen in emergencies
* Always be honest with why it is changing
* Sometimes meetings change and it is unavoidable, be clear as to why, is the plan to reschedule or to cancel. When rescheduling be sure to offer new timing/ days
* Be honest – do not ask “is it okay to rearrange this meeting” if you need it rearranged, you force people to either say “yes” regardless of their actual feelings or if they say “no” it gets awkward
