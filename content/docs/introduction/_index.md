# Introduction to the team

We are the CDU data science team. We sit inside a larger team (CDU) which has interests in public health, epidemiology, and advanced analytics (which is where we come in :smile:).

We are a small team, but we have a large diversity in life circumstances. So, we all make work work for our lifestyles. We have a range of skills and areas of expertise and thus working collaboratively to achieve end goals is always recommended.

## Working Times

Core hours vary considerably between team members, and there is a lot of flexibility with core hours with prior agreement with the line manager. Flexibility is not only allowed but recommended if it benefits you. Some team members vary their number of hours week to week, working longer some weeks and taking those hours back in subsequent weeks. Team members may send messages out of hours, but that is purely because it works for them, and will not expect anything immediate in response.

## Working Location

The team is primarily virtual. If desired there is space in Nottingham (Duncan Macmillan House - Mapperley) that can be utilised, and some people do hybrid working. The wider CDU (outside of the data science team) are considering some in person social events but there is no pressure for attendance and nothing critical happens.
