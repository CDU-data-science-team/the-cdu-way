title: "The CDU way"
type: docs
---

This is a repository to describe the CDU data science team's approach to everything. It is designed as a resource for new starters, as well as a reference for existing team members. Producing the document collaboratively is also an excellent way of agreeing a common approach to things, which can save confusion and conflict in the long run.

We share this work with an open licence in the hope that it can help other teams who are trying to do similar things. Equally, if you spot errors or you have ideas for improvements, we are always very happy to receive issues and pull requests :hugging_face:

This is a work in progress but expect to see sections covering:

* R development
* Openness and licensing
* Git, GitHub, and collaborative working
* Meetings and appraisals
